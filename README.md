TIY Week 1, Day 2: Learning HTML & properly link pages

Star is a simple 3 page website, but includes many of the most important elements of the HTML language.

Your task is to convert the provided text into valid HTML pages. Evaluate the text files and review the screenshots of all three pages. Determine, to the best of your ability how to markup the elements to create a valid HTML document.

At the end of this assignment, you should have three pages linked together by navigation. Take a look at the screen shots and the source text files.
